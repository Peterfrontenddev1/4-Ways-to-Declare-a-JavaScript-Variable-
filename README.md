The different ways to declare a variable in javascript


      Using var
      
      Using let
      
      Using const

Using var

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

      Example
      var x = 5;
      var y = 6;
      var z = x + y;
      
       Using let
In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword:

      Example
      let x = 5;
      let y = 6;
      let z = x + y;

In this example, x, y, and z, are undeclared variables:

      Example
      x = 5;
      y = 6;
      z = x + y;

In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:

      Example
      const price1 = 5;
      const price2 = 6;
      let total = price1 + price2;
